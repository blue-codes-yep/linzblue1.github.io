About Me</h1>
<p>
        Hi, i'm Paxton i've been on a computer since I was about 12 years old, wish I had been coding since then but sadly not I spent most my time gaming, as well as a little coding in C++ and VB whenever I was really young, coudn't tell you a single thing about C++ now though. I moved down to Demorest, Georgia from Tennessee to stay with my aunt, and uncle while I goto DigitalCrafts. I'd say my hobbies mostly consisted of hanging out with friends,gaming,coding in python, and just being on the computer in general. I threw this together really fast I'll polish it up and make it look a lot nicer, but I just wanted to get it out there and get something uploaded to github! :)
